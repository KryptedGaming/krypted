## Running
During development, we typically just use the provided development tools by Django.

1. Ensure you're in the `app` directory `cd krypted/app`
2. Run the webserver `python3 manage.py runserver`
3. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

That's it! For production deployment, refer to the User Guide.
