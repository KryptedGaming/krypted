## Contributing
Krypted accepts contributions in the form of **packages**, which are simply [reusable Django Applications](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/reusable-apps/). All of our community packages can be found [here](../features/community_packages/index).

Alternatively, you can contribute to our [Krypted Packages](../features/krypted_packages/index) in the form of pull requests. 

There are a few requirements to become a community package,
1. The application must separate, with the preferred installation being `pip3 install <package>`
2. The application must have test cases, with decent coverage. 
3. The application must be open source.
