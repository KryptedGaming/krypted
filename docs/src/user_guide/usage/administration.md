## Admin Panel
The administration panel is a feature of Django, and can be accessed by going to `https://<your_site>/admin`. This is where you set up package instances (e.g Discord and EVE Online), interact with the backend database, and create configuration for all Krypted packages. 

To view the administration panel, a user must be `staff`, and have permissions to view each section. `superuser` accounts can view all sections, regardless of permissions.
