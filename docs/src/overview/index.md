# Overview
Krypted is a community management and authentication platform created by [Krypted Gaming](https://kryptedgaming.com/). *It is heavily influenced by EVE Online authentication platforms like [SeAT](https://github.com/eveseat/seat) and [AllianceAuth](https://gitlab.com/allianceauth/allianceauth).* 

The purpose of Krypted is to help online gaming communities **manage their members**, **sync groups across a multitude of third-party platforms** (chat programs, voice programs, forums), and **provide useful tools for managing in-game entities** like EVE Online corporations, World of Warcraft guilds, and other popular MMO entities. 

The Krypted platform is written in **Python**, utilizing the **Django** framework.
