## Google Analytics 
To be eligible for the [EVE Online Parter Program](https://www.eveonline.com/partners), Krypted Platform uses [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/). This data follows all standard Google protocols, and prompts you on your first visit to the website. 

This data is anonymous, and used for usage and user demographics only. To disable Google Analytics, have your administrator add `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=False` to your environment file.

## Character Data
By default, packages that store character data will **delete** that data when the character or token is removed. This is to protect you from groups trying to use your character data for shady purposes. 

Most APIs have a thiry party application page for revoking tokens, for example [EVE Online](https://community.eveonline.com/support/third-party-applications/). Make sure you are familar with these services when pulling your tokens from Krypted Platform.
