Important Changes Celery container ( krypted_celery ) has been merged into the krypted container, with multiple entrypoints. Google analytics and GDPR cookie consent have been added.

New \"Settings\" Page Administrators now have access to Settings in the sidebar, which will allow you to manage your packages and settings all from one page. We're planning to expand this out further, which should allow package developers to create rich configuration menus. Doctrine Filtering We've added new filters to the Fittings and Doctrines tables, they're pretty neat. Characters Page The Characters page in the EVE Online Connector has been completely rebuilt, and it won't be ridiculously slow anymore! Bug Fixes We fixed pretty much every bug that was user reported in this release, meaning you'll want to check out minor packages like applications, etc. However, with system notifications we've been finding tons of new issues and enhancement areas, so our backlog is filled right back up again.
