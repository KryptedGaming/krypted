Without contributors like you, our platform wouldn't be special! Installation Follow Local Installation instructions here . Development Environment VSCode is our recommended IDE. We recommend the Python extension and py-coverage-view . Juniper Notebooks is highly recommended. Follow instructions from the ./launcher install and use python3 manage.py shell_plus --notebook . Windows users are highly recommended to use WSL2 . Special Sauce There's a ton of special sauce baked into the platform to make your life easier. Package Template We recommend forking from our package template to follow our practices. Launcher What is the launcher? The launcher is our developer tool that handles a lot of the common commands that you'll be running. It's made to run in the root project directory, and helps you handle things like running Django, celery, and coverage. Understanding the launcher will save you a ton of time, and we highly recommend you use it when developing extensions. Launcher Commands Command Description launcher env Creates a virtual environment, enable it with source ./myvenv/bin/active launcher install Installs the development enviroment launcher test Runs the application tests with code coverage launcher run Runs the web application on 127.0.0.1:8000 launcher celery Starts the Celery worker and Celery beat launcher flower Launches Celery flower on 127.0.0.1:5555 Extending the Launcher The launcher is written in Shell, so simply add a function and case statement for it, and you're good to go! Sidebar Extensions Including your extension in the sidebar is fairly easy, we automatically check for sidebar.html in every EXTENSION template folder. Check out this example. Package Binder The package binder is a way to check for versions, requirements, and celery tasks for your application. See this example. . Check out the code under if apps.is_installed('packagebinder') . Contribution Guildelines Krypted accepts contributions in the form of packages , which are simply reusable Django Applications . All of our community packages can be found here . Alternatively, you can contribute to our Krypted Packages in the form of pull requests. There are a few requirements to become a community package, The application must separate, with the preferred installation being pip3 install <package> The application must have test cases, with decent coverage. The application must be open source.
